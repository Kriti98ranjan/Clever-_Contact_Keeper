and Hibernate. It features an easy login and registration system with server-side 
validations and secure password encryption using BCrypt. Users can securely save their 
contacts on the cloud with Spring Security integration. The system includes a user
friendly dashboard for managing contactsâ€”viewing, adding, updating, and deleting them 
as well as profile management
